# hackerspace-iot-project
a simple project that reads temperature and humidity values using a dht 11 sensor and displays on an app. and a motion detector that alerts when motion is detected.
we used an DHT11 sensor that gives us the values of humidity and temperature. those values were accessed by the BLYNK app. similarly we used a PIR sensor to help with the motion detection part. we used an nodeMCU as the main device to bring together all these parts. the blynk app acts as an interface to access the data. Due to some unfortunate reasons our sensors were fried so we weren't able to show the working.
